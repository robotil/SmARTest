	1. Find a 3d model online (recommended site - http://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com)
	2. Open the 3d model in SketchUp using "Import" option (if the model is .skp using Open File option is faster)
	3. Scale the model to your likness , delete unneccesry faces and vertexes , fix origin and so on.
	4. Export the file as COLLADA format using : "Export -> 3D model -> COLLADA(.dae) "
	5. Copy the files to the ubuntu machine (check if there are texture files from the export and not just .dae file)
	6. go to folder ~/username/srvss_ws/src/SRVSS/world_components
	7. copy an existing model folder , i.e. barrel1 , and change its name to the new model name
	8. open the new model folder
	9. modify model.sdf and model.config to match the new model files (remove the word barrel1 from then and insert the model name you decided)
	10. copy the files we got from the Exportation to model folder (the folder that inside our new model folder and name model , i.e. barrel2/model were barrel2 is our new model)
	11. open MeshLab
	12. load in MeshLab our new model using "import meshes" option
	13. rescale the model from meter to inches (note MeshLab only uses meter therefore we always need to rescale)
	14. rescale using : "Filters -> Normals, Curvatures , Oriantation -> Transformation : Scale"
	15. rescale change ONLY X axis by "0.0254" (meter to inch) and press "Apply" , make sure "Uniform Scaling" box is checked
	16. save our scaled model as .obj file using : "Export Meshes As -> .Obj"
	17. run in new terminal the command : "rosrun SRVSS SRVSS_EnvSetup" (this command will update .gazebo folder)
	18. update Resorces files and SFDP files to be able to use our new model.
	19. That ALL :)
	20. if the origin or scale of the model is too big or not fixed to origin go back to step 3.  , make sure the model isnt to complicated and gazebo loads it fast
